The GNURadio blocks implemented as part of this thesis are
shown in figure \ref{img:annotated_gnuradio_companion_detectors},
circled in red.

The purpose of these blocks is to take a stream of input signals
and to add annotations to this stream whenever a synchronization-preamble
is detected.
Figure \ref{img:annotated_gnuradio_companion_detectors_plot} shows an example output
of the detector blocks, where an an annotation is placed right at the start of a
synchronization sequence.

As performance is a major design goal in the implementation of these blocks,
all of them are written in C++ and some tricks are used to make them
perform well on a modern \acrshort{cpu}.

\begin{subchapter}{\acrlong{schcox} correlator}
  The functionality of the \acrlong{schcox} correlator
  block is shown in figure \ref{img:sc_correlator_blocks}.
  The block takes one input signal, calculates the correlation
  as described in the \acrlong{schcox} chapter and normalizes it
  with the average input power in the analyzed duration.

  It also outputs a delayed version of the input sequence so that
  a peak at the correlation output corresponds to the start of a
  preamble and not its end.
