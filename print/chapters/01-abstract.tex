This thesis will present an implementation and evaluation of a
multi-carrier synchronization algorithm implemented for use
in the GNU Radio framework. \\

To point out the special synchronization requirements
imposed by using multi-carrier systems in contrast
to single carrier systems both methods will be presented
with a special focus on synchronization.

Based on these observations a synchonization alogrithm
used in multi-carrier systems will be presented,
the \gls{schcox} algorithm. \\

Finally a fast implementation of the \gls{schcox} algorithm
implemented in optimized C++ for the GNU Radio framework
will be presented and its performance will be analyzed
in terms of synchronization accuracy and processing speed. \\

The implementation will be tested for its ability
for being used in realtime high datarate applications
like a pure software implementation of WiFi using
software defined radios.
